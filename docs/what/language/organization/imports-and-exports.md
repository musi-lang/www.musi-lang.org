Imports say what this file depends on. Exports say what this file offers to others. Together they form the public hallway between rooms in the package.

A clean import list helps readers see the file's outside needs before reading the body. A clean export list keeps accidental helpers from becoming promises.

## Imports should feel boring

If an import surprises you, the file may be doing work from the wrong layer. A receipt format tool importing low-level runtime operations is a smell unless formatting truly owns that edge.

## Exports create commitments

Once another file uses an exported name, changing it becomes a package-wide decision. Export the stable idea, not every helper that made the idea possible.

Imports and exports are also the first map a new reader gets. A file that imports payment, clock, and logging code announces that it crosses an edge. A file that exports only `formatReceipt` announces that the rest is private craft.

Organization chapters explain where code lives. Packages group files, imports bring names in, and exports let other code use names.

Messy organization starts when every file reaches for every name. Keep imports narrow, export only the names another file needs, and let file names explain the job before a reader opens them.
