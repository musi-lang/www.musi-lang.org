Generics let one definition work with many types. A box can hold a book, a toy, or a receipt; the rules for storing and returning the item may not care which one it is.

{{snippet:chapter-generics}}

Use generics when the structure is the same and only the contained type changes. Do not make code generic just because it feels flexible; generic code should still have a clear job.

## Real reusable forms

Lists, options, results, boxes, and identity helpers are natural generic forms. They talk about how values move, not about one particular app topic.

## Type parameters need meaning

Short names such as `T` are fine when the role is obvious. When there are several type parameters, choose names that explain the relationship: `Key`, `Value`, `Input`, `Output`, or a topic name.

Types are labels that prevent later guesswork. A ticket number, room name, function value, and generic box can all be written as values, but type notes say which promises the code expects to keep.

Do not add type detail as decoration. Add it when it helps a reader, fixes an edge, explains a public API, or lets generic code say exactly which kind of value it can accept.
