Indexing selects by position. Field access selects by name. Both are ways to move from a larger value to the part needed for the next expression.

Choose the access style that matches the data. A row in a timetable may be indexed by slot. A booking record should use fields because the pieces have names.

## The reader's question

When reading `customer.address`, the question is answered immediately: this code needs the address. When reading `items.[2]`, the reader asks why the third item matters. Good code answers that question nearby.

## Keep paths short

Long chains of fields and indexes can make ownership unclear. If a path is important, name the intermediate value: `shippingAddress`, `firstPet`, or `primaryContact`.

Short paths also improve error messages and hovers. When an editor can highlight `shippingAddress.city` as a record field rather than a vague nested expression, the code becomes easier to inspect. Names are not only for humans; they give tools better handles too.

Data chapters teach the what a room can be before anyone moves through it. A record is a labeled card, an array is an ordered row, a variant is a set of named doors, and a pattern is a safe way to open one door at a time.

Most data bugs start when one form is asked to mean too many things. If a value can be absent, use an absent-value form. If a value has named parts, use a record. If a value can be one of several cases, use data variants.
