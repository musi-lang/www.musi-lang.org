summary: "Use `let` to name values, define callables, and understand when recursion needs `let rec`."

Values are the nouns of a Musi program. A `let` named part gives one of those nouns a stable name so later code can talk about it without repeating the whole expression. If a program is a small cafe, `menuPrice`, `tableNumber`, and `receiptText` are easier to follow than the arithmetic and string building repeated everywhere.

Names are also a way to mark intent. A number named `3` tells you almost nothing; a value named `retryLimit` tells you how the number is used. That makes the compiler's work easier to explain and a reader's work much easier to finish.

## When the name refers back to itself

Some values are defined in terms of a smaller version of the same problem. Counting boxes in a nested shipment, walking a family tree, or computing a countdown all have that form. Musi uses `let rec` when a named part needs to call itself.

Recursive named parts need a visible smaller step. If each call gets closer to the simple case, the definition reads like a set of instructions. If the next call repeats the same input, the program is like a delivery driver circling the same block.

Read this chapter like a short errand. First find the names, then find the value each name holds, then ask what the last expression gives back. A cafe ticket, a room card, a pet tag, and a bus route all become easier when each useful fact has a clear name.

A common mistake is to race toward large examples. Stay small until the form feels normal. One file, one value, one block, and one changed value teach more than a page full of clever tricks.
