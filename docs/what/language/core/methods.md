Methods let a value carry useful actions near its type. A `Person` can expose a display name, a `Cart` can compute a total, and a `Dog` can report whether it needs a walk.

{{snippet:chapter-methods}}

Method syntax reads from the value outward. That makes chains natural when each step transforms the same idea, such as trimming a name and turning it into a normalized key.

## Good receiver choices

Put a method on the type that owns the idea. A car should know whether its fuel is low; a payment processor should not be hidden inside a car. When the receiver is obvious in normal speech, the method belongs there.

## Avoiding mystery chains

Chains become hard when each method changes the subject. Keep method chains for steady transformations. If a chain jumps from customer to order to warehouse to email, split the steps and name the intermediate values.

Core forms are the basic parts of the language. Literals are values, calls ask for work, operators join values, ranges mark spans, and lambdas carry a small action. Learn each form before using it in larger data or effect code.

When a core form feels hard, use a simple example. Try a ticket price plus a fee, a room number in a range, a message sent through a callable, or a small action saved as a lambda. The syntax keeps that example exact.
