Literals are values written directly into the program: numbers, text, booleans, and similar small facts. They are useful for examples, defaults, and obvious constants.

A literal should not hide a business rule. The number `18` in a cinema app may mean adult age, screen number, or row count. A name such as `adultAgeLimit` lets the next reader know which fact the program depends on.

## Everyday facts in code

Text literals make labels, messages, and file paths visible. Numeric literals can express small counts, prices, limits, or indexes. The value is not the whole story; where it is placed tells the reader how it is being used.

## When a literal deserves a name

If changing a literal would change policy, name it. A delivery fee, retry count, or school passing grade should not be scattered through a file as repeated numbers.

Core forms are the basic parts of the language. Literals are values, calls ask for work, operators join values, ranges mark spans, and lambdas carry a small action. Learn each form before using it in larger data or effect code.

When a core form feels hard, use a simple example. Try a ticket price plus a fee, a room number in a range, a message sent through a callable, or a small action saved as a lambda. The syntax keeps that example exact.
