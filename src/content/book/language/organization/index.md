summary: "Grow from one file to packages without changing the mental model of code flow."

Organization begins when one file stops being enough. The language does not change at that moment, but the reading problem does. A reader now needs to know which file owns which idea, which names cross file edges, and which settings make the project repeatable.

Files are the first edge. A file should have one main reason to exist: invoices, addresses, animal records, command-line entry, or runtime helpers. Packages are the larger edge. A package says these files ship together, share configuration, and form one project.

Imports and exports are the hallway between rooms. Imports show what a file needs from outside. Exports show what the file promises to other files. That promise matters. Once a helper is exported, it stops being private craft and becomes part of the package's public face.

This part is intentionally practical. It is about keeping a codebase navigable when examples turn into projects. A small recipe app may start as one file; later it may split ingredients, lists, and meal plans. A payment tool may split card validation, receipt format, and log writing. The split should help readers find the right room.

By the end, you should know when to add a file, when to keep a helper private, and when a package setting belongs in `musi.json` instead of one person's editor.
